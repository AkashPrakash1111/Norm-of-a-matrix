# Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 1-norm, 2-norm and infinity norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1. Get the input matrix using np.array()   
2. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
3. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
## Program:
```
# Register No:24008757
# Developed By:Akash Prakash
# 1-Norm of a Matrix
import numpy as np
arr=np.array(eval(input()))
result=np.linalg.norm(arr,1)
print(result)
```



# 2-Norm of a Matrix
```
'''
Program to find 2-norm of a matrix.
Developed by: Akash Prakash
RegisterNumber: 24008757
'''
import numpy as np
arr=np.array(eval(input()))
result=np.linalg.norm(arr,2)
print(round(result,2))
```




# Infinity Norm of a Matrix
```
import numpy as np
arr=np.array(eval(input()))
result=np.linalg.norm(arr,np.inf)
print(result)

```
## Output:
### 1-Norm of a Matrix
